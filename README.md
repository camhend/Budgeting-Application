This is a desktop budgeting application. The user can set monthly budgets using the Budget tab, add expenses with the Expense tab, and view some analytical data on the dashboard tab. Each tab allows switching between currently available months. In order to add a new month to start budgeting, navigate to the Budget tab to add a new month, then expenses can be tracked for the new month. On the Expenses and Budget page, click Save to save the edited information. Budget and Expense data will be saved in CSV format in data files.

This project was built using Maven in a Model, View, Controller Design Pattern. Expenses and Budget information is managed by separate models, then display for each tab page is managed by a separate controller, with views created through JavaFX.

Included in this repository is some sample data to illustrate typical usage.
